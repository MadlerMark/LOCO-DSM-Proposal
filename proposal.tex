\section{General Design}
This work will consist of modifying an existing compiler (gcc or llvm) to 
support LOCO as a backend for disaggregated memory. Generally this compiler will 
look up address locations on loads and stores to determine whether it is local/remote 
and will also determine whether it is cached or not. Additionally all cached data will 
be tagged with a dirty delta to allow for seamless release consistency. On releases 
data will be written back to its home-node and only modified data will be written back 
(scatter). If two nodes wish to write back the same byte-area they are in a data race 
and it is the programmers fault. 

There will be {} major components in this design. They are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Load/store compiler modification.
    \item synchronization primitive modification for OpenMP.
    \item non-cached memory will be stored as a hash map.
\end{itemize}


some outstanding questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item does the local node cache its own data?
    \item does a system like this exist for TCP/IP?
    \item specifics of design implementation.
\end{itemize}

\section{My TODO list}
\begin{itemize}
    \item get cmatose.c working on r320s to diagnose issue. (is it librdmacm?)
    \item change all config scripts in Odyssey.
    \item Finish this proposal.
\end{itemize}
